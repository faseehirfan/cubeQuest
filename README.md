Designed and programmed a CAD model for a robot prototype to autonomously collect and move cubes to the end zone. 

Built with on VEX V5. 
Developed a search algorithm to detect cubes on the field, leveraging ultrasonic and gyroscope sensors.
Programmed motor control functions for driving, stopping, and precise turning based on gyro feedback.
